# Aeon

Aeon will eventually be an interpreted, gradually typed programming language,
heavily inspired by languages such as Smalltalk, Ruby, and Rust.

For now it's nowhere close to being ready. The code is in a constant state of
flux and a _lot_ of work has to be done. Contributions will most likely be
rejected for the time being. Once I feel Aeon is stable enough I'll set up a
proper contributing guide, README, license, etc, etc.
