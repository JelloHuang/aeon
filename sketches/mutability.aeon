# By default everything in Aeon is immutable, including HashMap, Array, etc. To
# make something mutable you can use the "mut" keyword.

let numbers = [10, 20, 30]

numbers.push(10) # compiler error since "numbers" is immutable

let mut numbers = [10, 20, 30]

numbers.push(10) # works fine now since "numbers" is mutable

# Same with hashes:

let ages = {'Alice': 27}

ages['Bob'] = 25 # compiler error

# Now make it mutable
let mut ages = {'Alice': 27}

ages['Bob'] = 25
